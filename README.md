### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started. This program makes your robot move upward, uses the radar module to locate an enemy robot, and then fires a component towards it. The #![allow(unused_must_use)] attribute is used to suppress warnings about unused results from certain function calls.

```rust
#![allow(unused_must_use)]
use rbot;

pub fn main() {
    // Move the robot upward with the specified velocity
    rbot::velocity(0.0, 1.0, 1.0);

    // Wait for the Radar module to become available
    rbot::modules::await_module(rbot::modules::Module::Radar);

    // Retrieve the radar message, which contains the position of the enemy robot
    let radar_msg = rbot::modules::radar().expect("failed to get radar message");

    // Convert the enemy's position (x, y coordinates) to an angle
    let angle = rbot::conversions::xy_to_angle(radar_msg.x, radar_msg.y);

    // Aim at the enemy robot using the calculated angle
    rbot::await_aim(2, angle, 0.5);

    // Wait for the component to be ready
    rbot::await_component(2);

    // Fire the component towards the enemy robot
    rbot::use_component(2, false);
}
```
